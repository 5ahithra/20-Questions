Project created for CS3 Class. This assignment focuses on binary trees and recursion. Objective of the project is to recreate 20 questions games.20 Questions is a guessing game in which the objective is to ask yes/no questions to determine an object.
In our version, the human begins a round by choosing some object, and the computer attempts to guess
that object by asking a series of yes/no questions until it thinks it knows the answer. Then, the computer
makes a guess; if its guess is correct, the computer wins, and otherwise you win. For example, consider
the following game:
>> Is it an animal? (y/n)? n
>> Does it have wheels? (y/n)? y
>> I guess that your object is bicycle!
>> Am I right? (y/n)? y
>> Awesome! I win!
